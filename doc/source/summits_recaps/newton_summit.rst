Newton OpenStack summit recap
=============================

During OpenStack Newton Summit in Austin our team had the first results sharing
and plans preparation session. That was the first summit after the Mitaka design
summit at Tokyo when the team was originally kicked off.

OpenStack Performance Team: Current Progress and Future Plans
-------------------------------------------------------------

Our first session was dedicated to share results of Mitaka development cycle.

During that time frame Performance documentation was kicked off, first pack of
test plans and test results were published (mostly focused on
infrastructure-level components - RabbitMQ, SQL database, for operators willing
to run containerized OpenStack first pack of container repositories test
results).

The original `etherpad`_ contains all data regarding that session.
