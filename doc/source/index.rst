Performance Documentation
*************************

Abstract
========

This documentation section aims to introduce ideas and best practices on how
OpenStack cloud may be exercised to evaluate its performance, what can be
called performance at all and how it can be measured. Here you will find both
testing/probing methodologies and test plans, proposed by OpenStack community
members (as well as results of their execution against various cloud
topologies).
