Background
==========

Grid'5000 [#]_ is a large-scale and versatile testbed for experiment-driven
research in all areas of computer science, with a focus on parallel and
distributed computing including Cloud, HPC and Big Data.

The platform gives access to approximately to 1000 machines grouped in 30
clusters geographically distributed in 8 sites.

The Open accessÂ [#]_ program allows external users to get an account on the
platform. 

Hardware
========

Due to the numerous use cases the platform addresses, servers and network
configuration [#]_ may differ between different clusters but remain homogeneous
inside the same cluster.
